It's also a coming-of-age movie which celebrates the intensity of childhood friendship, while gently mourning the transience of such bonds. Which is why, unlike its central character, it'll never get old.Read Empire's review of Stand By MeBuy the film now\n"],["Raging Bull","1980","Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro have together made movies better than their boxing biopic, but it's hard to argue that any of those movies feature a more jaw-dropping performance than De Niro's here as self-destructive pugilist Jake La Motta.

His movie about the 1912 sinking of the world's biggest cruise liner was the most expensive ever made, suffered a difficult, overrunning shoot, and was predicted to be a career-ending flop. But it turned out to be one of the most successful films of all time (in terms of both box office and Awards), and made him King Of The World.Read Empire's review of TitanicBuy the film now\n"],["Good Will Hunting","1997","Remember when young actor buddies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay? Might seem odd now, but Damon and Affleck's heartfelt story of a friendship between a troubled maths genius (Damon) and his unconventional counsellor (Robin Williams, who also won an Oscar) deserved the accolade. What happened to those guys, anyway?...Read Empire's review of Good Will HuntingBuy the film now\n"],["Arrival","2016","Denis Villeneuve's empathic, perception-bending alien visitation drama is a delicately crafted modern rework of The Day The Earth Stood Still — except the extra-terrestrials are truly otherworldly and there's the sky-high obstacle that is the language barrier. With its message that open-minded communication enables us to realise the things we have in common with those who appear vastly different, it feels like genuinely compulsive viewing for these troubled times.Read Empire's review of ArrivalBuy the film now\n"],["Lost In Translation","2003","Sofia Coppola's second film is the ultimate jet lag movie, locating its central almost-romance between listless college grad Scarlett Johansson and life-worn actor Bill Murray amid the woozy, daydreamy bewilderment of being in a very foreign country and a very different time zone. And it's exactly right that we still don't know what he whispered to her at the end.Read Empire's review of Lost In TranslationBuy the film now\n"],["The Princess Bride","1987","Director Rob Reiner and writer William Goldman's affectionate pastiche of romantic fairy-tale stories. It doesn't just include one of cinema's greatest swordfights, or one of its most entertaining battles of wits, but it also has a doozy of a sickbed-storytelling framing device, during which narrator Peter Falk suffers interruptions from his grandson (Fred Savage), even pausing and rewinding the action.Read Empire's review of The Princess BrideBuy the film now\n"],["The Terminator","1984","It features time travel and a cyborg, with car chases and shoot-outs, but in James Cameron's first proper movie (ie not featuring flying piranhas) it's all packed around the blood-covered endoskeleton of a relentless-killer horror pic.

But Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's first feature is genuinely stand-alone: a savvy blend of proper-funny comedy and seriously gruesome undead-horror which, funnily enough, played a big part in the zombie-movie resurgence we're still enjoying now.Read Empire's review of Shaun Of The DeadBuy the film now\n"],["The Exorcist","1973","William Friedkin's horror masterwork — in which a 12-year-old girl is possessed by a demon — has a reputation as a shocker (in the good sense), with the pea-soup vomit, head-spin and crucifix abuse moments the most regularly cited. But the reason it chills so deeply is the way it sustains and builds its disquieting atmosphere so craftily and consistently throughout.Read Empire's review of The ExorcistBuy the film now\n"],["Predator","1987","A pumped-up men-on-a-mission movie with an ingenious science-fiction tweak. When you've got the world's baddest asses on the march, it'd be rude not to have them stalked by an intergalactic hunter with space-dreads and a shoulder-mounted laser cannon. \"You're one ugly motherfu...\" Never a truer word…Read Empire's review of PredatorBuy the film now\n"],["Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade","1989","You voted… wisely. There may only be 12 years' difference between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, but it's hard to imagine two better actors to play a bickering father and son, off on a globetrotting, Nazi-bashing, mythical mystery tour.

Of course, its greatest strength is in Natalie Portman, delivering a luminous, career-creating performance as vengeful 12-year-old Mathilda, whose relationship with the monosyllabic killer is truly affecting, and nimbly stays just on the right side of acceptable.Read Empire's review of LéonBuy the film here\n"],["Rocky","1976","John G. Avildsen's boxing drama is the ne plus ultra of underdog sports movies. It not only proves that winning isn't the most important thing (you gotta go the distance), but also enabled Sylvester Stallone to craft a character so convincing and emotionally absorbing, he's still appearing in movies almost 40 years later.Read Empire's review of RockyBuy the film here\n"],["True Romance","1993","Tony Scott's handling of Quentin Tarantino's script came off like the cinematic equivalent of cocaine-flavoured bubble-gum: a bright, flavoursome confection that had an intoxicatingly violent kick. It also drew some tremendous big names to its supporting cast. Samuel L.

Just, wow.Read Empire's review of True RomanceBuy the film here\n"],["Some Like It Hot","1959","It says a lot about the magnitude of Billy Wilder's talent that he took a reportedly awful shooting experience with a pill-addled Marilyn Monroe and turned it into a movie that features what is arguably her best performance, not to mention one of his own finest features. This cross-dressing caper also has what must be the greatest last line in history: \"Well, nobody's perfect\"…Read Empire's review of Some Like It HotBuy the film here\n"],["The Social Network","2010","Or, I'm Gonna Git You Zuckerberg. Portrayed as an über-ruthless ultra-nerd by Jesse Eisenberg, it's fair to say the Facebook founder came out of David Fincher's social-media drama smelling less of roses than the stuff you grow them in. But it _is_ great drama, expertly wrought by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who exploits the story's central paradox (a guy who doesn't get people makes a fortune getting people together online) to supremely juicy effect.Read Empire's review of The Social NetworkBuy the film here\n"],["Spirited Away",null,"2001For a Western world raised on Disney movies, Spirited Away was a bracing change of pace – pure, uncut Studio Ghibli. Taking in bathhouses, spirits of Shinto folklore, and morality without clear-cut distinctions of good and evil, Hayao Miyazaki's major crossover hit is distinctly Japanese. Its narrative arc and characters feel notably different to more conventional British and American animations – from the eerie, inscrutable No-Face, to sort-of-antagonist bathhouse owner Yubaba. But that's also a major reason why it connected – Spirited Away is accessible, but nothing about it feels watered down. It is, of course, utterly beautiful too – boundlessly imaginative, steeped in gorgeous colour, and stunningly scored by Joe Hisaishi. Among the cultural specificity is a coming-of-age universality in young hero Chihiro, forced to fend for herself when her parents are turned into pigs, using her resourcefulness and her friendship with boy-dragon-spirit Haku to earn her freedom from the spirit world. It's the film that brought Studio Ghibli – and anime at large – to mainstream Western audiences, an influence increasingly felt in the likes of Moana and Frozen II.Read the Empire review.Buy now on Amazon.\n"],["Captain America","2016","The third \"solo\" Cap outing managed to be both intensely crowd-pleasing (with that whole airport battle, and the introduction of Tom Holland's Spider-Man) and also daringly intelligent, placing its superheroes in a believable geopolitical context that raised a valid moral issue: who should be responsible for the deployment of such great power?Read Empire's review of Captain America: Civil WarBuy the film here\n"],["Oldboy","2003","Chan-wook Park's revenge drama does extremity with a capital Eeek. Torture through 15 years of solitary? Check. Hammer-wielding violence? Check. Incest? Check. Live octopus-eating? Check, check, chuck-up. But it never feels crowbarred-in. It's all part of the deliciously dark and stylishly executed journey.Read Empire's review of OldboyBuy the film here\n"],["Toy Story","1995","It may have kicked off the whole CG-animation revolution (for better or worse), but it's not the once-novel visual medium which makes Pixar's first feature one of cinema's greatest treasures. The clue's in the title: it's a perfectly formed story, about friendship, love, fear of abandonment, workplace politics and self-identity. While its ability to make you laugh is undiminished.Read Empire's review of Toy StoryBuy the film here\n"],["A Clockwork Orange","1971","The controversy surrounding Stanley Kubrick's pop-art visualisation of Anthony Burgess' dystopian mediation on violence and free will may have long-since subsided, but the film's no less powerful. Especially that \"Singin' In The Rain\" sequence, which remains one cinema's most deeply upsetting.Read Empire's review of A Clockwork OrangeBuy the film here\n"],["Fargo","1996","Joel and Ethan Coen's snowy crime comedy is the best example of the 'crap criminal' subgenre, reminding us that wrongdoers are very rarely slick, professional types, and more usually people who are either inept or just winging it. But it has a very good heart, of course, in the form of Frances McDormand's Marge, whose brightness remains undimmed by the horrors she witnesses.Read Empire's review of FargoBuy the film here\n"],["Mulholland Dr.","2001","David Lynch messes with Hollywood itself in a mystery tale that's as twisted as the road it's named after, while presenting Tinseltown as both Dream Factory and a realm of Nightmares. It also put Naomi Watts on the map; her audition scene remains as stunning as it was 16 years ago.Read Empire's review of Mulholland DriveBuy the film here\n"],["Seven Samurai","1954","A film so good they remade it twice — as The Magnificent Seven, then as Battle Beyond The Stars. Or four times, arguably — if you count A Bug's Life and the remake of The Magnificent Seven. You could also make the case that Avengers Assemble is a version, too. The point is this: Akira Kurosawa's epic, 16th century-set drama about a motley gang of warriors uniting to save a village from bandits couldn't be more influential. Cinema simply wouldn't be the same without it.Read Empire's review of Seven SamuraiBuy the film here\n"],["Rear Window","1954","Photographer LB Jeffries (James Stewart) is on sick leave, with a broken leg. He's bored to tears, so he starts spying on his neighbours. Then he witnesses a murder. OR DOES HE? Alfred Hitchcock really knew how to take a corker of a premise and spin it into a peerless thriller (that's why they called him The Master Of Suspense), but Rear Window also deserves praise for an astonishing set build: that entire Greenwich Village courtyard was constructed at Paramount Studios, complete with a drainage system that could handle all the rain.Read Empire's review of Rear WindowBuy the film here\n"],["Hot Fuzz","2007","Wright, Pegg and Frost's tribute to big American cop movies isn't just a great fish-out-of-water comedy, sending high-achieving London policeman Nick Angel (Pegg) to the most boring place in the UK (or so it seems). It also manages to wring every last drip of funny out of executing spot-on bombastic, Bayhem-style action in a sleepy English small-town setting.Read Empire's review of Hot FuzzBuy the film here\n"],["The Lion King","1994","It's the highest-ranking animated movie on this list, beating even Toy Story. Though we shouldn't be too surprised — it remains one of Disney's most beautifully rendered films, an epic tale of dynastic dastardliness in the Animal Kingdom, with catchy songs and still one of the most distressing death scenes in a kids' movie since… well… Bambi.Read Empire's review of The Lion KingBuy the film here\n"],["Singin' In The Rain","1952","A joyous, vibrant Technicolor celebration of Da Moofies that's such an essential viewing experience there should perhaps be a law that it feature in every DVD and Blu-ray collection. It's no mere Hollywood self-love exercise, though. As star Don Lockwood, Gene Kelly brings a sense of exasperation at the film industry's diva-indulging daftness, making it a gentle piss-take, too.Read Empire's review of Singin' In The RainBuy the film here\n"],["Ghostbusters","1984","As high-concept comedies go, Ghostbusters is positively stratospheric — a story of demonic incursion… with gags! And it manages to wring a fantastic supernatural adventure out of that concept, while never neglecting the opportunity to deliver a great laugh; or, on the flipside, ever allowing the zaniness to swallow up plot coherence. Ray Parker Jr was right. Bustin' did indeed make us feel good.Read Empire's review of GhostbustersBuy the film here\n"],["Memento","2000","Christopher Nolan made the world sit up and pay attention to him by crafting (with his brother Jonah) a revenge-fuelled crime thriller that dared to demand that its audience sit up and pay attention to its every last detail. It's precision-engineered: apart from the carefully inserted Sammy Jankis subplot, every scene lasts as long as the span of damaged protagonist Leonard Shelby's short-term memory, as well as running in reverse order. And. It. Works.Read Empire's review of MementoBuy the film here\n"],["Return Of The Jedi","1983","In this post-Phantom Menace world, the Ewoks don't seem quite so egregious, do they? Endor's teddy-bear guerillas might have got sneered at, but they shouldn't blind us to Jedi's assets: the explosive team-re-gathering opening; the crazily high-speed forest chase; and that marvellously edited three-way climactic battle that dextrously flipped us between lightsabers, spaceships and a ferocious (albeit fuzzy) forest conflict.Read Empire's review of Return Of The JediBuy the film here\n"],["Avengers Assemble","2012","With Marvel's 'Phase One'-concluding team-up movie, writer-director Joss Whedon not only pulled off a colossal character-juggling act, he also pushed the studio's commercial success to a much higher level.

And let's not forget how goddamn funny it is, too.Read Empire's review of Donnie DarkoBuy the film here\n"],["La La Land","2016","As much a technical marvel as it is an acting tour-de-force, Damien Chazelle's Los Angeles love letter proved a ridiculously easy movie to fall in love with, even for those who may have grumbled that they weren't really into musicals before sitting down to watch it.

It announced a bold new filmmaker in Mendes, and also got writer Alan Ball (Six Feet Under, True Blood) rolling.Read Empire's review of American BeautyBuy the film here\n"],["E.T. – The Extra Terrestrial","1982","With the \"Amblin\" style so regularly referenced these days (most successfully in the Duffer brothers' Stranger Things), it's worth reminding ourselves that it was never more perfectly encapsulated than in E.T.: a children's adventure which carefully beds its supernatural elements in an utterly relatable everykid world, and tempers its cuter, more sentimental moments with a true sense of jeopardy.Read Empire's review of E.T.Buy the film here\n"],["Inglourious Basterds","2009","From its Sergio Leone-riffing opening to its insanely OTT, history-rewriting finale, Tarantino's World War II caper never once fails to surprise and entertain.

Though, of course, you could always argue that Fletcher's methods certainly got great results out of Miles Teller's battered but triumphant Andrew…Read Empire's review of WhiplashBuy the film here\n"],["Reservoir Dogs","1992","Quentin Tarantino's terrific twist on the heist-gone-wrong thriller, which ricochets the zing and fizz of its dialogue around a gloriously intense single setting (for the most part) and centres the majority of its action around one long and incredibly bloody death scene. Oh, and by the way: Nice Guy Eddie was shot by Mr. White. Who fired twice. Case closed.Read Empire's review of Reservoir DogsBuy the film here\n"],["Pan's Labyrinth","2006","Guillermo Del Toro's fairy tale for grown-ups, as pull-no-punches brutal as it is gorgeously, baroquely fantastical.

They could be the guy sat right next to you, in fact...Read Empire's review of PsychoBuy the film here\n"],["Once Upon A Time In The West","1968","This epic ballad of revenge, redemption and the painful rooting of civilisation in the Old West is peak Sergio Leone. Like The Good, The Bad And The Ugly it concerns three men — one mysterious (Charles Bronson), one seemingly amoral (Jason Robards) and one evil (Henry Fonda, playing brilliantly against type) — but this time Leone gets to shoot it against the epic vistas of the real American West.Read Empire's review of Once Upon A Time In The WestBuy the film here\n"],["It's A Wonderful Life","1946","Frank Capra's Christmas fantasy was the movie that coaxed a war-battered James Stewart back to acting, and a good thing, too: as George Bailey, who's shown a mind-blowing parallel reality in which he never existed, Stewart was never more appealing. And he tempers any potential schmaltz, too, with a sense of underlying world-weariness — one that he no doubt brought back from the conflict in Europe.Read Empire's review of It's A Wonderful LifeBuy the film here\n"],["Lawrence Of Arabia","1962","If you only ever see one David Lean movie… Well, don't. Watch as many as you can. But if you really insist on only seeing one David Lean movie, then make sure it's Lawrence Of Arabia, the movie that put both the \"sweeping\" and the \"epic\" into \"sweeping epic\" with its breath-taking depiction of T.E. Lawrence's (Peter O'Toole) Arab-uniting efforts against the German-allied Turks during World War I. It's a different world to the one we're in now, of course, but Lean's mastery of expansive storytelling does much to smooth out any elements (such as Alec Guinness playing an Arab) that may rankle modern sensibilities.Read Empire's review of Lawrence Of ArabiaBuy the film here\n"],["Trainspotting","1996","For their follow up to the superb Shallow Grave, Danny Boyle (director), Andrew Macdonald (producer) and John Hodge (screenwriter) foolhardily elected to film the supposedly unfilmable: Irvine Welsh's scrappy, episodic, multi-perspective novel about Edinburgh low-lives.

But Sidney Lumet's film finds all its drama outside the courtroom itself and inside a jury deliberation room packed with fantastic character actors, who are forced to re-examine a seemingly straightforward case by lone-voice juror Henry Fonda.

The Marvel Studios movie most-beloved by Empire readers is the one which featured the MCU's freakiest and least-known characters (a talking racoon, a walking tree, a green assassin lady, a muscleman named after a Bond villain and Star-who!?), starred that schlubby fellah from Parks And Rec, and was directed by the guy who turned Michael Rooker into a giant slug-monster in Slither. Which is pretty cool, when you think about it.Read Empire's review of Guardians Of The GalaxyBuy the film here\n"],["Schindler's List","1993","Spielberg's masterpiece, hands down. You might say the shark looks fakey in Jaws. You may wonder how Indy clung to the German sub in Raiders. But there's no flaws to be found in his harrowing, (mostly) monochromatic depiction of Nazi persecution of the Jewish community in Kraków. Unless you're the kind of shallow person who only watches movies that are 'entertaining'. In which case, you're missing out.Read Empire's review of Schindler's ListBuy the film here\n"],["The Usual Suspects","1995","Ninety-five's other super-twisted, über-cool crime thriller starring Kevin Spacey (next to Seven — see entry 30). While the line-up team-up is a great concept, director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie's movie attains true greatness through its supernatural-horror-style backdrop, conjuring a phantom menace — Keyser Soze — who terrifies even the most hardened criminal.Read Empire's review of The Usual SuspectsBuy the film here\n"],["Taxi Driver","1976","Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader's gripping portrayal of a mentally crumbling Vietnam vet (Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle) who ultimately figures the only way to wash the crime-caked streets of New York is with a nice, big bloodbath. Everyone here's at the top of their game: Scorsese, Schrader, De Niro, 14-year-old Jodie Foster and composer Bernard Herrmann. Yes, it's still talkin' to us.Read Empire's review of Taxi DriverBuy the film here\n"],["Seven","1995","Aka David Fincher's second debut movie. What sounded like a daft, novelty serial-killer thriller turned out to be a deeply rattling proper-shocker, which had the guts to throw down its biggest narrative twist halfway through, as warped murderer-moralist John Doe gives himself up. A twist made all the more effective thanks to Kevin Spacey's insistence he wasn't billed until the end credits.Read Empire's review of SevenBuy the film here\n"],["The Big Lebowski","1998","You've got to hand it to the Coen brothers. Not only did they make arguably the funniest movie of the '90s — which has since spawned a genuine film cult — they also managed to construct a kidnap mystery in which the detective isn't a detective and nobody was actually kidnapped. With bowling, marmots and a urine-stained rug.Read Empire's review of The Big LebowskiBuy the film here\n"],["Casablanca","1942","When you've got such a clear-cut good-vs-evil scenario as World War II, it takes guts to put out a film which lets its (anti-) hero lurk for so long in a grey area of that conflict — while said War was still raging, no less. Of course, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) eventually does the right thing, but watching him make both the Resistance and the Nazis squirm right up to the final scene is truly joyous.Read Empire's review of CasablancaBuy the film here\n"],["The Good, The Bad And The Ugly","1966","Sergio Leone sets three renegades against each other in a treasure hunt backdropped against the chaos and madness of the American Civil War. The result is the movie on his CV which best balances art and entertainment.

Don't talk.\"Read Empire's review of The Good, The Bad And The UglyBuy the film here\n"],["Heat","1995","Michael Mann's starry upgrade of his TV movie LA Takedown squeezed every last drop of icon-juice out of its heavyweight double-billing, bringing Pacino and De Niro together on screen, sharing scenes for the very first time. The trick was to only do it twice during the entire running time, with that first diner meeting virtually fizzing with alpha-star electricity.Read Empire's review of HeatBuy the film here\n"],["Terminator 2","1991","Making Arnie's T-800 a protector rather than killer for part two could have been a shark-jump moment for the Terminator series, but we're talking about James Cameron here. So it paid off — especially as this Terminator was just as much a student in human behaviour (with John Connor his teacher) as guardian, with some darkly comical results (\"He'll live\"). Is it really better than the original? In terms of scale and sheer, balls-out action spectacle, yes.Read Empire's review of Terminator 2: Judgment DayBuy the film here\n"],["The Matrix","1999","How two sibling indie film-makers with only a slick, sexy little crime film to their name (Bound) created their own blockbuster sci-fi franchise. And opened up western audiences to the truth that kung-fu acrobatics are so much more fun than watching American or European muscle-men waving guns around. While also making everyone examine some fundamental philosophical questions about reality. Thanks to the Wachowskis, we all took the red pill, and we've never regretted it.Read Empire's review of The MatrixBuy the film here\n"],["The Lord Of The Rings","2002","Aside from Boromir, Aragorn and the small-town denizens of Bree, there's not a huge amount of human representation in The Fellowship Of The Ring. So one of the pleasures of The Two Towers is seeing Middle-earth truly open out after the arrival at Rohan, where the series takes on more of a sweeping, Nordic feel... Building up, of course, to Helm's Deep, a ferocious action crescendo which features gratuitous scenes of dwarf-tossing.Read Empire's review of The Two TowersBuy the film here\n"],["Apocalypse Now","1979","The film-maker go-to movie du jour. Gareth Edwards cited Coppola's vivid and visceral jungle trek as a major influence on Rogue One; Jordan Vogt-Roberts drew from it extensively for Kong: Skull Island, and Matt Reeves sees War For The Planet Of The Apes as his own simian-related tribute. Hardly surprising; it's both a visually rich war movie and also a powerfully resonant journey into the darkest recesses of the human soul.Read Empire's review of Apocalypse NowBuy the film here\n"],["2001","1968","You've voted it your favourite Kubrick movie, which makes sense to us. It is arguably his greatest gift to cinema, an infinitely ambitious vision of a space-faring future whose narrative centres on the most pivotal moment in human evolution since some ape-man first bashed another ape-man with an old bone. Graceful, gorgeous, unwearied by time's passing. Rather like that monolith.Read Empire's review of 2001: A Space OdysseyBuy the film here\n"],["Die Hard","1988","One man using only his wits and whatever he can extract from his environment. A gang of bad guys terrorising the locals. If Die Hard wasn't set in a skyscraper during the 1980s, it could easily be a Western. A Western which, in the form of Bruce Willis, not only convinced the world a TV-comedy star could be an action-hero, but also gave us one of our most seethingly charismatic big-screen villain-players: Alan Rickman.Read Empire's review of Die HardBuy the film here\n"],["Jurassic Park","1993","When dinosaurs first ruled the movie-Earth, they did so in a herky-jerky stop-motion manner that while charmingly effective, required a fair dose of disbelief-suspension. When Steven Spielberg brought them back on Isla Nublar, we felt for the first time they could be real, breathing animals (as opposed to monsters). And that's as much thanks to Stan Winston's astonishing animatronics work as to ILM's groundbreaking CGI.Read Empire's review of Jurassic ParkBuy the film here\n"],["Inception","2010","Will Christopher Nolan ever make a Bond movie? Well, with Inception he kind of already has. Except, instead of a British secret agent, we get a freelance corporate dream-thief. And the big climactic action sequence is so huge it takes up almost half the movie and is actually three big action sequences temporally nested inside each other around a surreal, metaphysical-conflict core.Read Empire's review of InceptionBuy the film here\n"],["Fight Club","1999","After all the pre-release hype about how dark and brutal Fight Club was, one of the most surprising things to discover on seeing it was just how funny it actually was. And just as well; if you weren't laughing at Bob's \"bitch-tits\" or Tyler Durden's human-fat soap-making antics, it would be pretty hard to process David Fincher's bravura take on Chuck Palahniuk's tale of modern masculinity running insanely rampant.Read Empire's review of Fight ClubBuy the film here\n"],["The Lord Of The Rings","2003","Anyone who bangs on about all those endings is missing the many joys of Peter Jackson's Academy Award-laden trilogy-closer. It has some of the most colossal and entertaining battle scenes ever mounted; it has an awesome giant spider; it has that fantastic dramatic-ironic twist when Gollum saves the day through his own treachery; and it has that bit where Eowyn says, \"I am no man\". Deserves. Every. Oscar.Read Empire's review of The Return Of The KingBuy the film here\n"],["Aliens","1986","The genius of James Cameron's self-penned Alien follow-up was to not try to top the original as one of the greatest ever horror movies. Instead, he transplanted the Alien (and, significantly, Ripley) to a different genre, and created one of the greatest ever action movies. That's also a Vietnam metaphor. And also one of the most enduringly quotable films.Read Empire's review of AliensBuy the film here\n"],["Alien","1979","On the one hand, re-watching Ridley Scott's deep-space monster-slasher (and it's a movie which can handle as many re-watches as you can throw at it) makes you appreciate why he keeps coming back to that universe: it's so intoxicatingly atmospheric and deeply compelling, it sticks to you like a parasite. On the other hand, it really does make you wonder why he feels the need to keep tinkering with new cuts. After all, he got it perfectly right the first time around.Read Empire's review of AlienBuy the film here\n"],["Blade Runner","1982","Rain-lashed, noodle-bar-packed streets shrouded in perpetual night, with giant adverts and neon signs doing the job you'd usually expect of the sun itself...

Not that any studio these days would dare put out a summer blockbuster that's half monster-on-the-rampage disaster, half guys-bonding-on-a-fishing-trip adventure.

Or just because it's genuinely unsurpassable.Read Empire's review of JawsBuy the film here\n"],["Raiders Of The Lost Ark","1981","In '81, it must have sounded like the ultimate pitch: the creator of Star Wars teams up with the director of Jaws to make a rip-roaring, Bond-style adventure starring the guy who played Han Solo, in which the bad guys are the evillest ever (the Nazis) and the MacGuffin is a big, gold box which unleashes the power of God.

And its honesty was as impactful as its sudden outbursts of (usually Joe Pesci-instigated) violence.

Yeah, we happy.Read Empire's review of Pulp FictionBuy the film here\n"],["The Shawshank Redemption","1994","The warm, leathery embrace of Morgan Freeman's narration... The reassuringly Gary Cooper-ish rumple of Tim Robbins' face...

And it still hurts.Read Empire's review of The Empire Strikes BackBuy the film here\n"],["The Godfather","1972","Well, if Stanley Kubrick described it as \"possibly the greatest movie ever made,\" who is anyone else to argue? Francis Ford Coppola's gangster-movie-redefining adaptation of Mario Puzo's Mafia novel is the Empire Greatest Movies Poll No. 1 incumbent, and for a very good reason. It sits right at the juncture between 'classic' and 'modern' cinema; it feels respectably venerable, while at the same time vibrant and vital — not a dry, cinematic relic that you feel obliged to bow before, but a hot-blooded, living god that you embrace.The classicism is in no small part down to Coppola and cinematographer Gordon Willis' genius decision to shoot it with a minimum of modern film-making bells and whistles. We see the Corleones' '40s and '50s New York at eye level, never via the rooftop-scudding bird's-eye view of the helicopter-camera lens. And, in keeping with its underworld setting, it's moodily, dimly lit throughout, its underexposure lending it an aged, sepia-tinged quality.The modernism, meanwhile, is felt not only in its squib-heavy bloodletting, but also the way it handles the gangster flick itself. Back in the genre's heyday, Hays Code restrictions ensured it could only dole out rise-and-fall tales which established in no uncertain terms that the Mob was a seething, violent force of corruption that a good society would always quell. Here, though, we had an Italian-American film-maker (the first to make an American gangster film) showing the Mafia as something, if not quite sympathetic, certainly more human; an organisation which is very much the product of society, rather than simply a malevolent, morally alien force.That theme, of course, being brilliantly embodied by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone: the World War II hero, determined to stay distant from his Dad's dodgy business but who ultimately becomes enwrapped in its soul-tainting shadows. Brando may get the most attention as the wheezing Don, but there's no denying this is really Pacino's show.Read Empire's review of The GodfatherBuy the film here\n"]]}
